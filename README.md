## Introduction
The Intelligent Traffic Management System is a computer vision-based application designed to monitor and manage traffic in real-time. The system utilizes computer vision algorithms and deep learning models to process live or recorded traffic videos, detect vehicles, analyze traffic flow, and generate intelligent traffic insights. This project aims to improve overall traffic management, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety by providing valuable data to traffic authorities and planners.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection: The system can detect vehicles in a live traffic feed and track their movements.
- Traffic flow analysis: Analyze the traffic flow and congestion patterns at different times of the day.
- Vehicle counting: Count the number of vehicles passing through specific road segments.
- Speed detection: Measure the speed of vehicles to identify potential speed violators.
- Incident detection: Detect and alert on unusual events such as accidents or road blockages.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLO Algorithm
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
